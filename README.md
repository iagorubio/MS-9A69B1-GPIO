# MSI MS-9A69B1 Industrial Data Machine
## GPIO Access Code

This project implements a library for GPIO access on the MSI 
MS-9A69B1 Industrial Data Machine.

I don't have this box anymore so I can't test any problem that may be reported.

Use it at your own risk.

If you neeed to improve this code and you are willing to donate one of those boxes,
I will happily make any fix/improvement you require.

It have been done following the machine's documentation and tested on a unit we
had for a project.

AFAIK no problem was reported, so first just test it because most likely it will 
work out of the box.
